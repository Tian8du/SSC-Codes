In this work, we propose a spatially-informed interpolation framework for reconstructing long-term lake area time series from satellite-derived observations by leveraging semantic neighborhood correlation. This approach enables effective filling of missing observations under cloud contamination and limited temporal sampling, supporting large-scale water body monitoring and hydrological analysis.
